                <h3>A short introduction</h3>
                <p>Avatar The Last Airbender is a show that is very dear to my heart. I watched it growing up and still watch it now as an (almost) twenty year old. Avatar taught me a lot about caring for others, friendships, forgiveness and letting go in order to move on.</p>
                
                <p>No matter how old you are it's a story that will hit you right in the feels because it's so heavy (especially for a childrens show). The story is mostly about war and grief but somehow also manages to be funny and heartwarming.</p>
                
                <p>After Aang wakes up from being frozen in a major chunk of ice for about 100 years, he quickly learns about the war and how it destroyed everything he once knew.</p>

                <p>The series follows Avatar Aang and his friends on their rocky journey to defeating Fire Lord Ozai.</p>
