                <h3>Water bending</h3>
                    <p>Waterbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the hydrokinetic ability to control water in all of its various forms.</p>
                    <p>This type of bending is used by the people of the Water Tribe, who are divided into the Southern, Northern, and lesser-known Foggy Swamp tribes, as well as those of the United Republic, eacht with their own unique bending styles.</p>
                    <p>Water is the element of change. The moon is the source of power in waterbending, and the original waterbenders learned to bend by observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides. The Water Tribes are the only peopple who did not learn to bend from an animal, though the Moon and Ocean Spirits took the form of Koi Fish in the mortal world near the beginning of the Avatar world.</p>
                    <p>The fighting style of waterbending is mostly fluid and graceful, acting in concert ith the environment. Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy; they let their defense become their offense, turning their opponents' own forces against them. Even when waterbenders do take an attack stance, their moves always appear to flow from one to the other, mimicking the flow of the water they bend. Foggy Swamp style waterbending, however, is more rigid and straight, allowing for more direct bursts instead of long flowing streams of water.</p>
